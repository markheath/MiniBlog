  <content>&lt;p&gt;I was recently interviewed by Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell for their &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/Default.aspx"&gt;.NET Rocks&lt;/a&gt; podcast and the episode was published yesterday. You can have a listen &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=854"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I was invited onto the show after helping Carl out with an interesting ASIO related problem. I essentially built a mixer for his 48 in and 48 out MOTU soundcard. It is by far the most data that anyone has ever tried to push through &lt;a href="http://naudio.codeplex.com"&gt;NAudio&lt;/a&gt; (to my knowledge) and it did struggle a bit – he had to reduce the channel count to avoid corruption, but it was still impressive what was achieved at a low latency. However, I’m hoping to do some performance optimisations, and it would be very interesting to see if we can get 48 in and 48 (at 44.1kHz working smoothly in a managed environment). I’ll hopefully blog about it once I’ve got something working.&lt;/p&gt;  </content>

      <content>NoDriver calling acmFormatSuggest - probably means you don&amp;#39;t have the required ACM codecs. If you are running a Windows server, try installing the &amp;quot;desktop experience&amp;quot;</content>
