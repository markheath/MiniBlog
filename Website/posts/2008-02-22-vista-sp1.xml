  <content>&lt;p&gt;I installed Vista SP1 on my PC at home earlier this week. It took an hour to install.&amp;#160; I didn't notice any obvious improvements or changes at first. Perhaps it boots a bit faster now, but that kind of thing is very subjective unless you have bothered to time it beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, yesterday I found the first real improvement. I had been having problems saving my game in &lt;a href="http://fm08.footballmanager.net/en/article/100/index.html"&gt;Football Manager&lt;/a&gt; 2006. It would take several minutes to save the 200Mb file and would regularly fail to save. Sometimes I would have to attempt to save the game 5 times in a row before it would work. The good news is, that since installing Vista SP1, I have had no errors saving, and the saving is much, much faster (less than 30 seconds now). Its always nice to see some kind of tangible improvement after installing a service pack.&lt;/p&gt;  </content>
